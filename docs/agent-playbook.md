# Agent Playbook

## Source Of Truth
- `README.md` for repository scope.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` for contribution flow and commit conventions.
- `SECURITY.md` and `SUPPORT.md` for escalation paths.
- `profile/README.md` for org profile content.

## Repository Map
- `profile/` contains the public organization profile.
- Root Markdown files define shared contributor guidance used across repositories.

## Change Workflow
1. Read the existing policy files before editing wording.
2. Keep terminology consistent across all community files.
3. If you add a new policy, update the most relevant existing document instead of creating redundant guidance.
4. Check for broken links and obvious formatting regressions before committing.

## Validation
- Review Markdown files with `rg -n '^#|^##|^###' *.md profile/README.md`.
- If you change issue, PR, or branch guidance, confirm it does not conflict with active repository practices.
